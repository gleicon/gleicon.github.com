    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Note: this is an old post that I've had for months in my pipeline waiting for another project</h4>

<h4>The tab sink for the end of 2012 (originally I started this post Oct 20 2012)</h4>

<p>Most of these stuff were on my tabs for the whole week (and even weeks before that) and just now I managed to filter and check them.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Last month the Surge conference happened (http://omniti.com/surge/2012) with a lot of goodies. This week the videos were published and there's lots of good stuff. I can highlight two examples (not that the other are not good):</p>

<p>  <a href="http://omniti.com/surge/2012/speakers/bergman_artur">Arthur Bergman and Mysteries of a CDN explained (Fastly)</a></p>

<p>  <a href="http://omniti.com/surge/2012/speakers/canahuati_pedro">Pedro Canahuati and Operating at Scale (Facebook)</a></p></li>
<li><p>A distributed counter from basho, presented at <a href="http://basho.com/community/ricon2012/">RICON</a>: <a href="https://github.com/basho/riak_dt">riak_dt</a>. I think the videos are on the way. I've watched it through live streaming. Good stuff all around.</p></li>
<li><p>Still on conferences, it seems like <a href="http://monitorama.com/#speakers">Monitorama</a> will be interesting. There's lot on monitoring to be said - less on tools more on doing the smart things. (This presentation )[https://speakerdeck.com/u/obfuscurity/p/the-state-of-open-source-monitoring] from @obfuscurity is a great review and starting point. Fuck nagios.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to review (Agile Data)[http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781449326265/index.html] from Russel Jurney - although I always associeate "Agile" with bikeshedding this is only on the title and the book means it. From Chapter 2 on you will find practical examples on data analysis. The pieces on email are very interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>Sketching data structures are summaries of structures that otherwise would take a lot of space/time to process. <a href="http://lkozma.net/blog/sketching-data-structures/">This review</a> takes on Bloom Filters and Count-Min structures in a very clear manner. Be the smart guy in your local bikeshedding meeting by throwing away a "well we've had webscale data so I've reimplemented my indexes as count-min just for fun".</p></li>
<li><p>A series from Performance Dynamics on Little's Law and I/O performance <a href="http://perfdynamics.blogspot.com.br/2012/08/littles-law-and-io-performance.html">here</a> and <a href="http://perfdynamics.blogspot.com.br/2012/01/throughput-delay-curves.html">here</a> plus a piece on <a href="http://perfdynamics.blogspot.com.br/2010/03/bandwidth-vs-latency-world-is-curved.html">bandwidth vs latency</a>. Let's get educated.</p></li>
<li><p>A piece on <a href="http://markorodriguez.com/2011/09/22/a-graph-based-movie-recommender-engine/">graph based recommendation engine</a> using neo4j. Worth the exercise, this might help on event correlation too (same principle but diff techniques to relate cluster of data).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://notes.ceondo.com/mongrel2-zmq-paas/">A private PaaS with Mongrel2 and ZeroMQ</a> odd but very complete. I've tried with mixed results but can see the reasoning on extending mongrel2 to do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Still on PaaS <a href="http://blog.nonuby.com/blog/2012/07/02/what-happens-when-you-push-to-heroku/">What happens when you push to heroku</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openruko/">openruko github repo</a> are full of awesome by @nonuby</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/dotcloud/hipache">hipache</a> is a http and ws proxy/router. These things are the heart of a PaaS. I'd love to see it as a nginx module. It's doable with openresty but involves lua and other modules. From the great @dotcloud team.</p></li>
<li><p>We've started this year a series of techtalks at (http://www.locaweb.com.br) to spread the knowledge and create a sense of community inside the company. <a href="https://github.com/mediacore/mediacore-community">Mediacore</a> was our platform of choice to manage the videos. Yeah, create your own youtube etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Jeez I dont even.... <a href="http://browserver.org/">browserver</a> - it works, but oh god why :D nice code and concept, I wish it was torrent so we could p2p between browsers nearby.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Keep tuned. This list is bound to get back as soon as I clog my browser with tabs again ((anytime between one weekend/2 weeks)). Cheers.</p>
