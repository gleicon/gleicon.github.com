    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When modeling a distributed system one might stumble in the Actor model, implemented in one way or another - be it natively on Erlang or a complete library as Akka.</p>

<p>There is a lot of discussion over concurrency models, but regardless the Actor model serves well to break a task between different processes/servers.</p>

<p>Built usually over a messaging channel, these frameworks are usually adapted for a set of tasks.
As it wouldn't be different, some of them had a lot more than I needed, and the frameworks for Python were divided between trying to reimplement Akka or completely different concept.</p>

<p>I took some time out to build <a href="http://github.com/gleicon/mure">Mure</a> to learn more about kombu, a multi-transport library for python. It's a really simple actor library.</p>

<p>The decorator @worker() says that each time that a message to the queue named after the string arrives, the function might be executed having the message as parameter.</p>

<p>After fidling with <a href="https://github.com/jesusabdullah/pyee">pyee</a>, I've implemented an EventEmitter on top of it. The syntax is the same as node.js, but it's a distributed event emitter.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the search for the right backend to implement a metrics suited to my projects, I saw that <a href="http://aphyr.github.com/riemann">Riemann</a> (event server built on Closure) would save time by already having all kinds of math related to means, percentiles and a flexible configuration.</p>

<p>The protocol uses Google's Protocol Buffers, but it's very simple (I was able to go from 0 to a simple driver in less than 4 hours - including the protobuf part).
Basic functionality as sending metrics and querying are ready, but the driver still needs polishing - include a connection pool, and a twisted version. As it is right now, it works great with gevent apps.</p>

<p>A basic send/query app would be like this:</p>

<p>It supports both tcp and udp transports and includes the proper classes translated from protobuf spec to python. Requires google's protobuf library. The repo is on github <a href="https://github.com/gleicon/pyriemann">pyriemann</a>. There is an examples directory with riemann_health.py, translated from the ruby version to python.</p>
